# Pre-work - *TipTop app*

TipTop is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Quentin Picard**

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

I intend to keep improving my app.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges: I struggled to activate the persistence on the segmented control. I thought I had to find a different property to
force the % manually but selectedSegmentIndex worked fine.
I struggled to publish my project on Github. For some reason the publishing was failing. Turns out I had an empty project online
with the same name I was trying to use blocking the upload.
